This falls under analyst meetings, which typically receive a low score. However, the repeated upgrades from multiple institutions (RBC, National Bankshares, CIBC, Stifel Nicolaus, Raymond James Financial, Scotiabank) suggest a slightly more significant positive sentiment. The "outperform" ratings are a positive signal, but the stock traded down C$9.08, which tempers the positive impact. The consensus target price increase is a minor positive. The backward-looking data (1-year low/high, market cap, P/E, EPS, revenue, net margin) receives a very low score as it's not forward-looking. --- <br> - Stantec is receiving positive attention from analysts, with multiple price target increases and "outperform" ratings. The stock's potential upside of over 20% suggests a bullish outlook. Investors should consider this positive momentum alongside the company's financial metrics. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - RBC raised Stantec's (TSE:STN) price target to C$168.00 from C$153.00. - National Bankshares upped target from C$162.00 to C$164.00 ("outperform"). - CIBC raised target to C$175.00 ("outperform"). - Stifel Nicolaus increased target to C$175.00 ("buy"). - Raymond James Financial boosted target to C$160.00 ("outperform"). - Scotiabank raised target to C$161.00. - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy" with a consensus target of C$162.91. - Stock traded down C$9.08 to C$139.55 with volume of 468,607 shares. - 1-year low: C$107.23, 1-year high: C$160.05. - Market cap: C$15.92 billion, P/E ratio: 32.91, EPS: C$1.53. - Revenue for the quarter: C$435.10 million, net margin: 4.78%.

This falls under "analyst meetings" and generally indicates a positive outlook. While individual analyst upgrades typically receive a low score, the multiple upgrades from different institutions (TD Securities, CIBC, Raymond James, Desjardins, National Bankshares, Royal Bank of Canada) suggest a consensus, warranting a slightly higher score. The potential upside implied by the new target price (16.69%) further supports a positive sentiment. The backward-looking data (1-year low/high) and trading volume are given very low weight. The slight decrease in trading volume is a minor negative, but overshadowed by the positive analyst actions. --- <br> - Stantec (STN) is receiving positive attention from analysts, with multiple target price increases and "buy" or "outperform" ratings. The latest target price of C$183.00 suggests a potential upside of 16.69%. While trading volume is currently below average, the overall sentiment appears bullish, making it a potentially attractive investment. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - TD Securities raised target price to C$183.00 from C$176.00, rating "buy". - CIBC increased target price to C$175.00, rating "outperform" (Oct 20). - Raymond James Financial raised target price to C$160.00, rating "outperform" (Aug 15). - Desjardins increased target price to C$158.00, rating "buy" (Aug 15). - National Bankshares raised target price to C$164.00, rating "outperform" (Aug 15). - Royal Bank Of Canada raised target price to C$153.00, rating "outperform" (Aug 15). - Average analyst rating is "Buy" with a consensus target of C$159.33. - Stock traded down C$0.01 to C$156.83 with below average volume (86,816 vs 282,311). - 1-year low: C$107.23, 1-year high: C$159.99. - Market cap: C$17.89 billion.

Meeting EPS Estimates: (0.05) - Meeting EPS estimates is neutral, but slightly positive. Analyst Ratings: (0.05) - Several analysts maintain "Buy" or "Outperform" ratings. While analyst ratings generally receive a low score, the repeated mentions contribute slightly to the positive sentiment. FY 2025 EPS Guidance: (0.05) - The presence of FY 2025 EPS guidance is a positive sign, indicating forward-looking visibility. The following factors were considered but received minimal or no score: Revenue slightly missed estimates: This is a negative, but the overall tone is positive, so its impact is lessened. Backward-looking data: Information about past performance (e.g., last year's trends) was disregarded. Market cap, P/E ratio, Beta: These are standard metrics and don't inherently convey news. --- <br> - Stantec is attracting increased institutional investment and maintains a "Buy" rating from analysts.
