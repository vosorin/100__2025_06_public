The fact that WSP has a track record in similar projects (+0.1) adds to the positive sentiment. The mention of navigating New York's Article VII process is a neutral factor, as it's a standard regulatory hurdle. The backward-looking information about past projects receives a very low score. --- <br> - WSP's involvement in the $3.26 billion "Propel NY Energy" project signals a significant opportunity for the company, benefiting from New York's grid modernization efforts.

A feasibility study suggests the project is viable, which is a positive signal for future revenue generation and shareholder value. The study being prepared according to NI 43-101 standards adds credibility. The 14.07% surge in stock price also supports the positive sentiment. However, the technical report date (November 14, 2025) and effective date (October 20, 2025) indicate the information is relatively recent, but not immediately impactful. --- <br> - PMET Resources experienced a significant 14.07% surge today following the release of a positive lithium-only feasibility study for its Shaakichiuwaanaan Project.

Score: +0.2 Order Backlog Growth (WSP): A 10.6% increase in order backlog is a strong positive signal, indicating future revenue visibility. Score: +0.1 The news about Royal BAM and Skanska are largely neutral as they relate to competitors and don't directly impact WSP's financial outlook. The mention of potential acquisitions for WSP is a minor positive, but not significant enough to warrant a high score. --- <br> - Royal BAM is on track for a 5% EBITDA margin, while Skanska shows resilient margins despite weaker order intake. WSP demonstrates strong growth through acquisitions and organic expansion, maintaining an optimistic outlook. Investors should monitor order book trends and potential acquisitions. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Royal BAM: On track for ≥5% adjusted EBITDA margin for FY 2025. - Royal BAM: Order book steady at €12.5 billion. - Royal BAM: Secured €600M energy/water deal & €240M energy supply contract. - Skanska: Revenue up 8% to SEK 43.7 billion, operating income up 13% to SEK 1.4 billion. - Skanska: New orders down 17% to SEK 39.9 billion, book-to-build ratio at 106%. - Skanska: Project Development recorded a loss of SEK 0.3 billion. - WSP: Net revenue up 16% to C$3.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA up 20% to C$700 million. - WSP: Adjusted net earnings climbed 32% to C$369 million. - WSP: Order backlog grew 10.6% to C$16.4 billion, equivalent to 10.9 months of revenue.

The insider selling is a notable factor, but the overwhelming positive sentiment from analysts outweighs this negative signal.

This is a slight negative, but the expectation of organic growth returning in 2026 partially offsets it. strong backlog: Indicates future project pipeline (+0.1).
