The scheduled online date of 2027 indicates a future impact. Large contract wins: (0.3) - Securing 85 MW of projects backed by a 20-year PPA is a significant contract win, especially given the project size and long-term revenue visibility. Regulatory changes: (0.0) - The Multiannual Energy Programme (PPE2) is a regulatory program, but the news doesn't explicitly state whether it's beneficial or restrictive. Therefore, a neutral score. Backward-looking data/promotional language: (0.0) - The news focuses on a future project and its implications, minimizing the impact of backward-looking data or promotional language. --- <br> - Innergex's securing of 85 MW of agrivoltaic projects in France, backed by a 20-year PPA, demonstrates a commitment to the French market and provides revenue visibility. This expansion aligns with a strategy focused on contractual stability and rural development. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Innergex secures 85 MW in France via 6 agrivoltaic projects. - Projects awarded under the Multiannual Energy Programme (PPE2). - 53 MW awarded in the most recent session. - First project fully developed by Innergex in France. - Project located in Joux-la-Ville, Yonne department. - Scheduled online date: 2027. - 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) secures revenue. - Focus on rural development and job creation. - France becomes a strategic axis for Innergex's portfolio.

The project's capacity (200 MW) and annual generation (~5,000 GWh) are substantial, and it increases BC Hydro's power supply by eight percent. This contributes a score of +0.3. Strategic Partnerships/Joint Ventures: The partnership with the Stellaten First Nation, with the First Nation holding 51% equity, is a positive development, indicating a strong and collaborative relationship. This adds +0.3. Regulatory Changes: The expedited project development due to waived environmental assessments is a positive regulatory change, contributing +0.1. Product Launches: While not a product launch in the traditional sense, the Nithi Mountain Wind Project can be considered a new energy generation asset, contributing +0.2. Low scores for: The news does not contain any information related to quarterly/annual results, dividend changes, management changes, guidance updates, stock splits, share consolidations, lawsuits, debt restructuring, credit rating changes, buyback programs, FDA decisions, capital raises, bankruptcy filings, analyst meetings, cybersecurity incidents, political actions, or regulatory changes beyond the expedited approval. Promotional language and backward-looking data are minimal. --- <br> - BC Hydro's deal for the Nithi Mountain Wind Project, backed by the BC Utility Commission and expedited by regulatory exemptions, signals a significant expansion of clean energy capacity and strengthens First Nations partnerships. Investors should monitor Innergex's involvement and the project's progress. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - BCUC approved BC Hydro deal for Nithi Mountain Wind Project. - Project is part of 9 wind & 1 solar project approvals. - Nithi Mountain Wind Project capacity: 200 MW. - Total generation: ~5,000 GWh annually, powering ~500,000 homes. - Projects increase BC Hydro's power supply by eight per cent. - Total private capital spending: $5-$6 billion. - Environmental assessments waived, expediting project development. - Stellaten First Nation holds 51% equity; Innergex 49%. - Innergex involved in 3 of 9 northern BC wind projects. - Projects selected from 21 proposals submitted in April 2024.
