This directly aligns with the "accretive to DCF per share" event, warranting a +0.3 score. The undervaluation metric from Simply Wall St reinforces this. Free Cash Flow Projection: The news highlights a current negative Free Cash Flow, but projects a substantial increase to $1.86 billion by 2029. This positive future projection contributes to the overall positive sentiment, adding a small +0.1 to the score. P/S Ratio: The P/S ratio being below the industry and peer average suggests undervaluation, supporting the DCF analysis and adding a small +0.05 to the score. Backward-Looking Data & Volatility: The YTD and past year stock performance, as well as the recent pullback, are considered backward-looking data and volatility. These elements receive a very low score and do not significantly impact the overall assessment. Analyst Ratings/Narratives: The mention of "narratives" and the ability for investors to build their own thesis is promotional language and receives a very low score. Note: The potential upside of 90% is a significant factor, but it's based on a model and projections, so it's not given the highest possible score. --- <br> - B2Gold appears undervalued based on DCF and P/S analysis, with a potential upside of nearly 90% according to the DCF model. While recent volatility exists, the company's development projects and resource base growth suggest a potential opportunity for long-term investors. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - B2Gold's stock is up 60.9% YTD and 35.1% over the past year. - Recent pullback: 14.1% in the last week, 15.7% in the last month. - B2Gold scores 5/6 on Simply Wall St's undervaluation metric. - DCF model estimates intrinsic value at $55.13, suggesting an 89.2% discount. - Free Cash Flow is currently negative at -$297 million, projected to reach $1.86 billion by 2029. - P/S ratio is 2.59x, below the industry average of 5.71x and peer average of 10.78x. - Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for B2Gold is 6.54x, indicating undervaluation. - Narratives allow investors to build their own thesis and forecast future revenue.
