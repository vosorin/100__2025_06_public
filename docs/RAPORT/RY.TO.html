Score: +0.1 Q3 2025 Net Income & ROE: While the news mentions these figures, they are backward-looking data. Score: 0 TD Dividend Increase (9% annually over two decades): This is a significant positive signal regarding dividend policy. Score: +0.1 Brand Value Increase (RY: 31%, TD: 7%): While positive, brand value is a somewhat intangible metric and doesn't directly translate to financial performance.
