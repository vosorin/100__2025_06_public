Since the EPS of $1.13 isn't explicitly stated as above, aligned with, or below expectations, I'm assigning a slightly positive score of 0.2 to reflect the positive outlook and strong ratings. The "strong ratings" themselves suggest a positive assessment by analysts, contributing to the slightly positive sentiment. --- <br> - Metro Inc. (MRU.TO) reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.13.
