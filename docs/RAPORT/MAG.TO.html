I'm assigning a slightly positive score (+0.3) as the combination itself is a major event, and the details are not overwhelmingly negative. The news doesn't provide enough information to determine if it's accretive or dilutive. Index Removal: Removal from an index typically leads to some trading activity as index funds rebalance.
