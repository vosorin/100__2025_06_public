This falls under the "major dividend change" event, and a 4-6% growth target is above the threshold for a positive score (+0.2). The projection of revenue and earnings by 2028 also indicates a positive outlook, although the low absolute score is applied due to the long-term nature of the projection. The mention of "regulatory risks" and "fair value estimates range" introduces some uncertainty, preventing a higher score. The backward-looking information about 50 years of dividend increases receives a very low score. --- <br> - Fortis's consistent dividend growth and regulated utility assets remain attractive for income-focused investors. While regulatory risks and varied fair value estimates exist, the reaffirmed 4-6% dividend growth target through 2029 provides a positive signal for long-term returns. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Fortis has over 50 years of steadily increasing dividends. - Suitable for inflation-protected income, especially in TFSAs. - Reaffirmed 4-6% annual dividend growth target through 2029. - Projected revenue CA$13.8 billion and earnings CA$2.1 billion by 2028. - Fair value estimates range from CA$58.05 to CA$292.79 per share. - Regulatory lag and policy pushback remain key risks.

This is a potential headwind, but it's a general market risk rather than company-specific. The news contains some backward-looking data (H1 2025 earnings) and promotional language ("defensive investment," "strong track record"), which would normally receive a low score. However, the forward-looking dividend guidance and capital program outweigh this. --- <br> - Fortis (FTS) presents a defensive investment with a strong track record of dividend growth and a solid financial foundation. The potential for expansion and a reasonable dividend yield make it attractive amidst market uncertainty, though inflation risks remain. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Fortis (FTS) is a Canadian utility with $70B+ in assets. - Focuses on rate-regulated revenue from gas, power, and electricity. - Plans $26B capital program to increase rate base to $53B by 2029. - Expects 4-6% annual dividend increases until at least 2029. - Reported $883M net earnings in H1 2025, up $93M YoY. - Q3 2025 results expected in early November. - Potential for expansion in Canadian LNG and US electric grids. - Current dividend yield is 3.5%. - Faces risk if inflation causes central banks to halt rate cuts.
