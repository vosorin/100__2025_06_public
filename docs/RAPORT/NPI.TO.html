This signals a negative sentiment shift regarding the stock's near-term prospects. Here's a breakdown of the contributing factors: Analyst Meetings (Downgrades): -0.15. Multiple downgrades from reputable firms indicate a reassessment of the company's valuation and future performance. While the overall consensus remains a "Moderate Buy," the downgrades are a significant warning sign. Backward-Looking Data/Promotional Language: -0.05.

These are largely informational and don't reflect a clear, forward-looking change. Price Target Reductions: -0.05. The reduction in price targets, while not a direct event, reflects a diminished expected future value of the stock.
