High P/E and PEG Ratios: The relatively high P/E and PEG ratios are a negative signal, but the impact is mitigated by the analyst target price increases and dividend increase. This contributes a small negative score of -0.1. Analyst Rating: The "Hold" rating itself has minimal impact. Backward-Looking Data: The 52-week range and market cap are considered backward-looking and receive a very low score.
