This directly impacts Earnings Per Share (EPS), which only increased by 6.2% despite a 27% profit growth. This dilution is a negative signal for shareholders and warrants careful monitoring, as highlighted in the news. This aligns with the "share consolidations" event, which carries a negative score of -0.3. The news explicitly mentions dilution negatively impacting shareholder earnings, reinforcing the negative sentiment. The backward-looking data (profit growth, EPS increase) receives a very low score. --- <br> - Sienna Senior Living's earnings growth is being significantly diluted by a 14% increase in shares, resulting in only a 6.2% EPS increase. Investors should carefully monitor future EPS growth to assess the stock's potential. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - SIA's earnings report didn't move the stock market. - Share count increased by 14% over the last year. - Profit grew 27% in the last 12 months. - EPS only increased by 6.2% over the same period. - Dilution is negatively impacting shareholder earnings. - Future EPS growth is crucial for share price growth.

Occupancy increase (positive operational performance): +0.1 (94.1% to 94.7% is a positive trend, aiming for 95% is also positive) Acquired assets (potential for future growth): +0.05 (Acquiring assets totaling over $800 million in 2025 suggests future growth, but the impact is not immediate.) Revenue and FFO increase (positive financial performance): +0.05 (16.4% revenue increase and 33.3% FFO increase are positive indicators.) Debt-to-EBITDA ratio (debt management): -0.05 (While the company is aiming to reduce the ratio, the current 8.8x is a factor to monitor. The proactive strategies are positive, but the debt itself is a concern.) Liquidity and Assets (financial strength): +0.05 ($464 million in liquidity and $1.3 billion in unencumbered assets demonstrate financial strength.) The score reflects the overall positive operational and financial performance, tempered by the ongoing debt management considerations. --- <br> - Sienna Senior Living demonstrates strong growth with rising occupancy and NOI. While debt remains a factor, the company's proactive strategies and financial strength position it favorably for continued expansion. Investors should monitor debt management. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Q3 earnings call highlights robust growth and operational success. - Same-property NOI increased 13.2% (Retirement) & 6.7% (Long-Term Care). - Q3 occupancy reached 94.1%, increasing to 94.7% in October. - Acquired assets totaling over $800 million in 2025. - Revenue increased 16.4% year-over-year to $261.7 million. - Operating funds from operations rose 33.3% to $31.8 million. - Employee engagement score rose for the 5th consecutive time. - Debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 8.8x, aiming for under 8x pro forma. - Aims for 95% occupancy by year-end, lead generation up 37% YoY. - $464 million in liquidity and $1.3 billion in unencumbered assets.

This suggests potential future dividend cuts or reductions, triggering a score of -0.3. EPS growth projected: The projected 41.6% EPS increase next year is a positive signal, but the dividend sustainability concerns overshadow this. New shares issued: Issuance of new shares equivalent to 14% of outstanding shares is a dilutive action, contributing negatively to the score. Future payout ratio: The potential for the payout ratio to reach 158% next year reinforces the concerns about dividend sustainability. The rest of the news is either backward-looking or promotional, receiving very low absolute score values. --- <br> - Sienna Senior Living's upcoming dividend payment is accompanied by significant concerns regarding its sustainability. The high payout ratio (210% of earnings) and lack of free cash flow raise red flags for income-focused investors. Proceed with caution. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Upcoming dividend payment: CA$0.078 on December 15th. - Dividend yield: Approximately 4.7%. - Payout ratio: Currently at 210% of earnings, unsustainable. - EPS growth projected: Potential 41.6% increase next year. - Dividend growth: Less than 1% annually since 2015. - EPS growth over 5 years: Approximately 42% per year. - New shares issued: Equivalent to 14% of outstanding shares. - Future payout ratio: Could reach 158% over the next year.

This contributes a score of +0.2. analyst meetings: A price target increase from BMO is a positive analyst action. This contributes a score of +0.1. The rest of the news is promotional language and backward-looking data. --- <br> - BMO has increased its price target for Sienna Senior Living, signaling positive sentiment following their Q3 performance and future outlook.

This reinforces the DCF model's concerns and adds a minor negative impact of -0.1.
