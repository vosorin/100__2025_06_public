EPS Beat: The fact that AQN beat EPS estimates by $0.03 is a mildly positive signal, contributing +0.1. Institutional Buying: Significant increases in stake by several institutional investors (EdgePoint, Vanguard, BC Investment Management, Ariel, Goldman Sachs) signal confidence and contribute +0.1. Negative factors are minimal: The "Hold" consensus rating and the "Sell" rating from Weiss Ratings are noted but don't significantly detract from the overall positive sentiment driven by the upgrades and institutional buying. Backward-looking data (revenue, past year trends) are given very low weight. --- <br> - Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN) is receiving positive attention with several upgrades from analysts, despite a mixed overall rating.
