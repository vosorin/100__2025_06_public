This falls under the category of large contract wins. A contract win of this size (while not explicitly stated as a percentage of revenue, it's a significant order) is generally positive. Score Breakdown: Large contract wins: +0.3 --- <br> - This new order from the Canadian Department of National Defense, valued up to $8.1 million, provides a positive near-term revenue boost for AirBoss and demonstrates continued government support. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - AirBoss receives order up to US$8.1M. - Order from Canadian Department of National Defense.

This falls under a previously established contract (2018 JGSR). Here's the breakdown: Large contract wins or losses: The $8.1 million order is a positive contract win. While the exact percentage of revenue isn't specified, it's likely significant enough to warrant a score. I'm assigning +0.3. Delivery timeline: The delivery timeline (Q1 2026 - Q1 2027) is relatively far out. This reduces the immediate impact and lowers the score slightly. Forward-looking statements risk: The mention of risks associated with forward-looking statements introduces a degree of caution, which slightly reduces the positive impact. The combination of a significant contract win and a relatively distant delivery timeline results in a moderately positive score. --- <br> - AirBoss receiving an $8.1 million order from the Canadian DND is a positive signal, reinforcing the continued adoption of their LBM respirator. Investors should view this as a validation of their defense business momentum, though risks associated with forward-looking statements remain. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - AirBoss (TSX: BOS, OTCQX:ABSSF) received an order up to US$8.1M. - The order is for Low Burden Masks (LBM) from Canadian DND. - The order falls under the 2018 JGSR contract. - Deliveries expected Q1 2026 - Q1 2027. - LBM is a lightweight military respirator. - The order reinforces positive momentum in the defense business.

This qualifies as a large contract win. Given the size ($8.1 million) and the fact that it's a government contract, a score of +0.3 is appropriate. Positive near-term catalyst: This phrase indicates a positive impact on revenue, reinforcing the positive impact of the contract. This adds a small amount to the overall score. --- <br> - AirBoss secures a significant order from the Canadian Department of National Defense, potentially boosting revenue.
