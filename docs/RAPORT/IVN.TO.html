This directly impacts IVN.TO, as it's a copper producer. Here's a breakdown of the scoring based on the provided events: Guidance Updates: The revisions to production growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 (reduced growth rates) constitute a downward revision of guidance. This warrants a score of -0.2. Major Political Actions like war or major strikes: While not a direct political action, the "mine supply disruptions" can be interpreted as a disruption to operations, similar to a strike or geopolitical event. This contributes a small negative impact of -0.1. The rest of the news (stock levels, price forecasts) are either backward-looking or represent market conditions rather than direct actions by IVN.TO, so they receive minimal scoring. --- <br> - Copper market faces significant headwinds in 2025-2026 due to mine supply disruptions. Expect price volatility and potential supply deficits despite current surpluses. Investors should monitor mine production data and consider the impact on copper-dependent industries. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - ICSG highlights mine supply disruptions impacting copper production. - 2026: Projected copper production shortfall of 150,000 metric tons. - April forecast: Expected 209,000-ton supply surplus, now revised. - 2025 mine supply growth: Reduced to 1.4% from 2.3% (previous) & 2.8% (2024). - 2025 refined copper production growth: Revised to 3.4% from 2.9%. - 2026 production growth: Expected to slow to 0.9%. - Primary production constrained by concentrate shortage. - 2026: Anticipated copper market supply deficit after two surplus years. - 2024: Expected production surplus trimmed to 178,000 tons (from 289,000). - U.S. copper stocks exceed LME & Shanghai Futures Exchange combined. - LME three-month price: Currently near $11,000/ton (delivery Jan 2026).
