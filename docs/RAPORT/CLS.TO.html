This falls outside the scope of most of the listed events, which focus on fundamental financial factors. While a significant drop in stock price could be a signal of underlying issues, the article doesn't specify why the market is reacting negatively. The mention of a "bearish reversal" after a "recent rally" suggests a correction rather than a fundamental shift. The technical indicators (MACD/RSI divergence, volume surge) are not inherently negative financial events. The potential invalidation of the bearish thesis if the stock closes above 211 is a minor positive, but the overall tone is negative. Therefore, a slightly negative score is warranted. --- <br> - Celestica's stock experienced a significant drop due to bearish technical signals.
