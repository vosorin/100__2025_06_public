The negative aspects (analyst price target reductions) are offset by the positive signals of increased institutional interest and a positive earnings surprise. --- <br> - FirstService is experiencing increased institutional interest, with several funds boosting their holdings.

This falls outside of the defined events with significant financial impact. The mention of "downside risk" triggers a slight negative sentiment. The suggested trading strategies (LONG, BREAKOUT, SHORT) are purely speculative and don's reflect any fundamental change in the company's financial position.
