While the share price increase itself is a positive indicator of investor confidence and past performance, it's largely backward-looking data. The inclusion in the TSX30 suggests recognition of sustainable value creation, which is a positive signal. The commentary on "strong operational performance" and "disciplined capital allocation" hints at a positive outlook, but lacks specifics. The advancement of the Skouries project is a positive development, but its impact isn's quantified. Overall, the news is mildly positive, but the lack of concrete forward-looking financial details limits the score. --- <br> - Eldorado Gold's inclusion in the TSX30, driven by a remarkable 238% share price increase over three years, signals strong performance and investor confidence.

This contributes +0.2. Backward-looking data: The rock sampling results (0.2-1.0 g/t Au, up to 17 g/t Au and 11% Cu) are backward-looking data and receive a very low score. Other factors: Dropping the Francisco Jose IV and V option is neutral as it allows focus on existing projects.
