This falls under the "major dividend change" event. While the declaration itself is positive, the score is not significantly high because it's a standard announcement and doesn't indicate a substantial increase (above 5%). A stable dividend would receive a score of 0, and this declaration appears to be in line with expectations, thus a slightly positive score of 0.2 is appropriate. The exchange rate and payment details are irrelevant to the stock's value. --- <br> - Manulife declared a CAD 0.44 per share dividend for Q2 2025, payable September 2025.

Rationale: The news presents a mixed bag. The slight earnings miss is a negative, but the dividend increase and positive institutional investor activity are positives. The "Moderate Buy" rating from analysts adds a slightly positive sentiment. The stock price increase is a minor positive. The overall effect is cautiously positive, hence the score of 0.3. --- <br> - Federation des caisses Desjardins sold a small portion (1.0%) of their Manulife Financial holdings, but several other institutional investors increased their positions.
