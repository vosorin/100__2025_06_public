This falls under "analyst meetings" and warrants a slightly positive score. Specifically, the upgrades from Scotiabank, BMO Capital Markets, National Bank Financial, and National Bankshares contribute to this positive sentiment. The 52-week high is a consequence of this positive sentiment. The mention of a quarterly dividend is neutral as it's a recurring event and doesn't indicate a significant change ("major dividend change"). The dividend yield of 1.0% is relatively low and doesn't trigger a significant positive reaction. The information about the P/E ratio, P/E/G ratio, and Beta are backward-looking data and receive a very low score. The description of the company's operations is purely informational and doesn't impact the financial outlook. --- <br> - Altus Group (AIF) has reached a 52-week high, supported by several brokerage upgrades and a positive analyst rating. While the average target price is slightly below the current price, the upgrades suggest potential for further growth. Investors should consider the company's strong position in the Canadian real estate sector and dividend yield. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - AIF stock reached a 52-week high of C$62.08 on Thursday. - Scotiabank raised price target to C$53.00 on August 6th. - BMO Capital Markets increased target price to C$62.00 on May 6th. - National Bank Financial upgraded to "strong-buy" on August 6th. - National Bankshares upgraded to "outperform" and raised target to C$74.00 on August 6th. - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy" with a target price of C$60.20. - Market capitalization is C$2.65 billion. - P/E ratio is 7.04, P/E/G ratio is 0.96, Beta is 0.89. - Quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable October 6th. - Yield of 1.0%, annualized dividend of $0.60. - Operates in Canadian real estate, providing advisory and data solutions.
