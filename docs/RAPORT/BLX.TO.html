This falls under "analyst predictions" and "future expectations," warranting a positive score. (+0.2) Backward-Looking Data: The news includes information about past performance (recent decline, last year's decrease, three-year growth). This receives a very low absolute score. (-0.05) P/S Ratio: While the high P/S ratio is mentioned, it's presented as a result of future expectations, not a standalone event. Therefore, it doesn't directly contribute to the score. --- <br> - Boralex's high P/S ratio (3.4x) is supported by anticipated revenue growth exceeding the renewable energy industry average (14% vs 11%). While recent performance has been weak, positive future expectations are currently justifying the valuation. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Boralex (BLX) has a P/S ratio of 3.4x, above half of Canadian renewable energy companies. - Recent revenue declined, but investors anticipate a substantial recovery. - Last year's revenue decreased by 13%, impacting the three-year growth. - Three-year revenue growth stands at a decent 14%. - Analysts predict 14% revenue growth next year, exceeding the industry average (11%). - High P/S reflects expectations of stronger revenue performance. - Current investor sentiment supports the elevated P/S ratio.

However, a target price reduction from BMO Capital Markets slightly offsets this (-0.1). Net effect: +0.3 Dividend announcement: The announcement of a quarterly dividend is a positive signal, although the yield is not exceptionally high. +0.1 Backward-looking data/Promotional language: The article contains a lot of backward-looking data (52-week range, past trading volume) and analyst ratings, which receive very low scores. These are largely discounted. Stock price fluctuations: The mention of recent price fluctuations is neutral. Note: The upgrades are the most significant factor driving the positive score. --- <br> - Boralex (BLX) maintains a "Buy" rating with an average target price of C$39.00, despite recent price fluctuations. Analyst upgrades and a dividend announcement suggest positive sentiment. Investors should monitor the stock's performance relative to its target price and broader market trends. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - BLX has a "Buy" rating from six analysts, with a C$39.00 average target price. - Raymond James upgraded BLX to "moderate buy" on May 15th. - BMO Capital Markets reduced target price to C$39.00 on May 22nd. - National Bank Financial upgraded to "strong-buy" on June 8th. - TD Securities raised target price to C$38.00 and gave a "buy" rating on June 18th. - Desjardins set a C$45.00 target price and a "top pick" rating on June 18th. - Shares traded down C$0.22 on Friday, closing at C$28.88. - Volume was 363,114 shares, above the average of 331,028. - 52-week range: C$24.40 - C$36.63. - Quarterly dividend of C$0.165 to be paid on September 15th. - Annualized dividend yield is 2.3%. - Boralex is an electric utility company focused on renewable energy.

This directly reflects a negative outlook for future earnings, triggering a -0.2 score. While the analysts maintain a "Buy" rating and a target price, the lowered guidance overrides this slightly positive sentiment. The price target revisions from other institutions are less impactful as they represent adjustments to expectations rather than fundamental shifts in the company's prospects. The stock price and market cap are backward-looking data and are therefore ignored. --- <br> - Raymond James Financial lowered its FY2025 EPS estimate for Boralex, reflecting potential headwinds. While analysts maintain a generally positive outlook ("Buy" rating and average target price of C$38.89), investors should monitor earnings revisions and consider the lowered guidance. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Raymond James Financial lowered FY2025 EPS estimate from $0.94 to $0.89. - Consensus full-year earnings estimate is $1.34 per share. - Q4 2026 EPS estimate is $0.84. - National Bankshares cut price target from C$43.00 to C$41.00. - TD Securities raised price target from C$35.00 to C$38.00. - BMO Capital Markets cut price target from C$42.00 to C$39.00. - Average analyst rating is "Buy" with a target price of C$38.89. - Stock opened at C$29.64 on Wednesday. - Market cap: C$3.09 billion. - P/E ratio: 43.45.
