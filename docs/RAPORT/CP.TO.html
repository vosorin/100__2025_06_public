Score: -0.15 guidance updates: The revision of earnings estimates downwards is a clear negative guidance update. Score: -0.10 analyst meetings: The Zacks Rank is a form of analyst assessment, and the "Sell" rating is a downgrade. Score: -0.05 stock performance: The news highlights a negative stock performance compared to the industry.
