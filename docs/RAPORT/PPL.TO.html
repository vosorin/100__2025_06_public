This is a strong positive signal. Dividend Yield (0.05): The 7.4% dividend yield is attractive, especially for income-focused investors. While the payout ratio is slightly over 100%, it's not a severe red flag given the context of institutional support. Missed Earnings Expectations (-0.1): Missing Q3 EPS estimates by $0.14 is a negative, but the strong institutional buying somewhat mitigates this. Analyst Ratings (0): "Mixed ratings" receive a neutral score. There's no clear consensus. Revenue Decline (-0.05): A 2.9% year-over-year revenue decline is a minor negative. The positive signals from institutional buying outweigh the negative impact of the missed earnings and revenue decline. --- <br> - Pembina Pipeline is experiencing significant institutional buying interest, with multiple firms increasing their stakes. While recent earnings missed expectations and analysts have mixed ratings, the substantial dividend yield (7.4%) and ongoing institutional support suggest a potentially attractive opportunity for income-focused investors. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Geode Capital raised stake by 19.9% in Q2, owning 4,846,067 shares ($185M). - Goldman Sachs increased holdings by 78.1% during Q1, owning 7,088,945 shares ($283M). - Manufacturers Life increased stake by 136.7% during Q1, owning 3,995,460 shares ($160M). - Nuveen LLC bought new stake valued at $83.74M in Q1. - MUFG Securities EMEA purchased stake worth $52.51M in Q2. - AGF Management raised stake by 108.0% in Q2, owning 2,158,772 shares ($81M). - 55.37% of stock owned by institutional investors. - Analysts have mixed ratings: Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Sell. - PBA opened at $38.47 on Tuesday, market cap $22.35B. - Q3 EPS was $0.31, missing estimates by $0.14. - Revenue down 2.9% year-over-year to $911.47M. - Quarterly dividend of $0.71 to be paid on December 15th. - Dividend yield is 7.4%, payout ratio 101.00%.

This is a significant negative event. analyst meetings (-0.05): "Mixed analyst sentiment (ranging from Sell to Outperform)" and "Moderate Buy" rating suggest uncertainty and some downgrades, which is a slight negative. dividend change (0): The dividend is stable and attractive, but this is a standard dividend payment, not a change. share ownership changes (0): The news about institutional share ownership changes (Candriam, Cerity, Larson, Davis Rea) is largely neutral. While some increased and one decreased their stake, these are typical portfolio adjustments and don't inherently signal a major shift in sentiment. buyback programs (0): No mention of buybacks. stock price (0): The stock price information is backward-looking and irrelevant to future expectations. --- <br> - Pembina Pipeline faces mixed analyst sentiment (ranging from Sell to Outperform) and recently missed EPS estimates, impacting revenue. While a dividend yield of 7.4% is attractive, investors should carefully weigh the negative earnings report and analyst downgrades. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Candriam S.C.A. sold 9,149 shares, reducing its stake by 48.0% in Q2. - Cerity Partners LLC increased stake by 90.0%, owning 50,836 shares ($2,035,000). - Larson Financial Group LLC boosted stake by 53.4%, owning 1,341 shares ($54,000). - Davis Rea LTD. acquired a new position valued at approximately $4,432,000. - Analysts have a "Moderate Buy" rating on PBA. - PBA opened at $38.47 on Tuesday, with a 1-year range of $34.13-$43.44. - Q3 EPS was $0.31, missing the $0.45 estimate by ($0.14). - Revenue was $911.47 million, below the $1.42 billion estimate. - A quarterly dividend of $0.71 will be paid on December 15th, yielding 7.4%.

This is a slight positive, but the miss overshadows it. large contract wins or losses: Signed 20-year agreement with PETRONAS for Cedar LNG facility (+0.2).
