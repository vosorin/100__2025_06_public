The analyst upgrade from Wall Street Zen, although somewhat offset by the "Hold" consensus rating and $9.00 price target, still contributes a small positive score of +0.05. The fact that 78.65% of the stock is held by institutional investors is a neutral factor, but it does indicate a certain level of stability.

Free Cash Flow is currently $1.14 billion, projected to reach $2.39 billion by 2029: This is a positive projection, indicating future financial health. It contributes a small positive impact (+0.1).

The news focuses on potential undervaluation and future financial projections, which are positive indicators. The volatility is acknowledged but doesn't outweigh the positive signals. --- <br> - Bausch Health appears significantly undervalued based on DCF and P/E analysis, with a potential upside of over 90%.
