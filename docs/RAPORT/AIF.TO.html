This is a significant negative event. Score: -0.3 guidance updates: The news states "lowered guidance," which is a negative signal. Score: -0.1 analyst meetings: Multiple analysts have downgraded their price targets and ratings ("multiple analysts downgrading," "Barclays reduced target," "Bank of America lowered target," "Wall Street Zen lowered rating"). This is a strong negative signal. Score: -0.2 institutional investor activity: While some institutional investors increased their positions (iA Global Asset Management Inc., Covestor Ltd, Rakuten Investment Management Inc.), this is somewhat offset by the overall negative sentiment driven by the downgrades and earnings miss. The positive effect is minimal. Score: +0.05 The rest of the news (past performance, market cap, beta, etc.) contains information that is either backward-looking or promotional and therefore receives a very low score. The overall negative sentiment from the earnings miss, lowered guidance, and analyst downgrades outweighs the slight positive from institutional investor activity. --- <br> - DaVita (DVA) faces a challenging outlook with multiple analysts downgrading their price targets and ratings. While institutional investors show increased positions, the recent earnings miss and lowered guidance suggest caution. Investors should monitor future performance and analyst revisions before making investment decisions. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Target price set at $153.25 by analysts. - Consensus rating is "Reduce" from five analysts. - Barclays reduced target to $143.00, rating "equal weight". - Weiss Ratings reissued a "hold" rating on October 8th. - Bank of America lowered target to $140.00, rating "underperform". - Wall Street Zen lowered rating from "buy" to "hold" on October 11th. - Truist Financial set a $140.00 price target on October 14th. - Stock opened at $118.73, 1-year range: $117.73 - $179.60. - Market cap: $8.49 billion, P/E: 12.23, PEG: 0.91, Beta: 1.13. - Q3 EPS: $2.51, missing estimates by $0.66. - FY 2025 guidance: 10.350-11.150 EPS. - Analysts predict 10.76 EPS for the current year. - iA Global Asset Management Inc. raised position by 25.3%. - Covestor Ltd raised position by 61.7%. - Rakuten Investment Management Inc. acquired new position valued at $19.875 million. - 90.12% of stock owned by institutional investors.

Stock price movement: Breaking above the 200-day moving average is a moderately positive technical indicator, contributing +0.1. Dividend: The news mentions a quarterly dividend, but there's no change indicated, so it receives a score of 0. Market conditions/Risk tolerance: The cautionary language about broader market conditions and risk tolerance reduces the overall positive impact slightly. Backward-looking data: The mention of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages is largely backward-looking and receives a very low score.
