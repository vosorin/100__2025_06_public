This falls under the category of "guidance updates" and signals a shift towards economic support. A rate cut of 25 bps is a significant event. The expectation of rates falling to 2.25% and potentially 2% by the end of 2025 suggests a sustained easing of monetary policy.

The news also mentions a slowing economy and a weak job market, which introduces a slight negative element, but the overall expectation of rate cuts outweighs this. The stability of the Canadian dollar is a neutral factor. The mirroring of a global shift towards economic agility is a minor positive. --- <br> - The Bank of Canada is likely to cut rates to 2.25%, signaling a shift towards economic support.
