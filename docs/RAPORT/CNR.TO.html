This is a negative signal, impacting the stock value. The revenue decline also contributes to this negative assessment. analyst meetings (-0.05): While the analyst maintains a "Hold" rating, the lowering of the EPS estimate indicates a less positive outlook. institutional buying (+0.05): The increase in stakes by institutional investors suggests cautious optimism, slightly offsetting the negative impact of the EPS estimate reduction. lowered guidance (-0.03): The lowered EPS estimate can be interpreted as a form of revised guidance, albeit implicitly. Rationale: The primary driver of the negative score is the reduction in the EPS estimate and the miss on the actual Q3 results.
