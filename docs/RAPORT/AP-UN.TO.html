Backward-Looking Data: The news includes past performance data (52-week low, past year trends), which receives a low score. This slightly reduces the overall negative impact. Note: The average analyst price target being above the current price is a slightly positive factor, but the overall negative sentiment outweighs this. --- <br> - Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (AP.UN) is facing significant headwinds, indicated by its 52-week low and a "Reduce" rating from analysts.

Dividend (Neutral): Stable dividend with a reasonable yield (0). Insider Selling (Slightly Negative): EVP sales are a minor negative (-0.05). While insider selling isn't always a bad sign, it warrants monitoring.

This constitutes a significant negative signal for the stock. Analyst Meetings: The consensus "Reduce" rating and downgrades from multiple institutions (RBC, Desjardins, National Bankshares, TD Securities) strongly indicate a negative outlook. While Canaccord Genuity maintains a "Buy" rating, the overall trend is clearly downward. This contributes a score of -0.2. Backward-looking data: The inclusion of Q3 revenue and EPS, as well as analyst projections for the current fiscal year, are considered backward-looking and receive a very low absolute score. Price target revisions: The downward revisions of price targets across the board are a clear indication of reduced expectations for future performance. This reinforces the negative sentiment. The lack of any positive catalysts (e.g., accretive acquisitions, positive guidance, product launches) further supports a negative assessment. --- <br> - Analysts have a "Reduce" consensus rating on Allied Properties (AP.UN), with price target revisions downwards. Investors should proceed with caution, monitoring performance and reassessing if the stock can overcome negative sentiment and analyst downgrades. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - AP.UN has a consensus rating of "Reduce" from eight analysts. - Average 12-month price target is C$16.47. - RBC cut target from C$18.00 to C$16.00, rating "Sector Perform." - Desjardins cut target from C$18.00 to C$15.50, rating "Sell." - National Bankshares changed rating to "Underperform," target C$17.00. - TD Securities downgraded from "Buy" to "Hold," target C$16.00. - Canaccord Genuity cut target from C$22.00 to C$18.00, rating "Buy." - Stock opened at C$13.12 with a market cap of C$1.83 billion. - Q3 revenue was C$147.93 million, EPS of C($0.81). - Analysts project EPS of 1.84 for the current fiscal year.
