This directly relates to an accretive to DCF per share event. A 23% undervaluation, if credible, implies a potential for future price appreciation, justifying a positive score. Here's a breakdown of the scoring: accretive to DCF per share: +0.3 (The core of the news is the DCF model's conclusion of undervaluation, suggesting potential future accretion.) The disclaimer about the model's limitations and the need for due diligence prevents a higher score. The mention of risks and future capital needs also tempers the positive outlook. The use of a dividend discount model is a standard valuation technique, so it doesn't carry significant weight. --- <br> - Emera (EMA) appears potentially undervalued by 23%, with a fair value estimate of CA$86.87 based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Investors should conduct their own due diligence, considering the assumptions and limitations of the model, before making investment decisions. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - EMA's estimated fair value is CA$86.87, based on a Dividend Discount Model. - Current share price is CA$66.53, indicating a potential 23% undervaluation. - DCF model uses dividend payments, assuming a 2.6% annual growth rate. - Discount rate used is 6.0%, based on a levered beta of 0.800. - The model's accuracy depends on discount rate and cash flow assumptions. - DCF doesn't account for industry cyclicality or future capital needs. - Investors should explore risks, management actions, and other solid businesses. - Simply Wall St updates DCF calculations daily for Canadian stocks.

However, the "hold" rating from Desjardins slightly reduces this. Insider Selling: While insider selling is mentioned, it's generally viewed neutrally unless it's a massive or unusual amount. The sales are significant in volume but don't necessarily indicate a negative outlook (-0.1). Stock Price Movement: The stock traded up (+0.1). Neutral Factors: The news includes backward-looking data (past 90 days insider sales) and promotional language ("positive attention"), which receive very low scores. The positive analyst sentiment and stock price movement outweigh the insider selling, resulting in a slightly positive overall score. --- <br> - Emera (EMA) is receiving positive attention from analysts, with multiple price target increases and a "Moderate Buy" rating. While insider selling has occurred, the overall sentiment appears bullish. Investors should monitor analyst ratings and insider activity. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Desjardins raised Emera's target price to C$68 from C$64, maintaining a "hold" rating. - TD Securities increased target to C$74 with a "buy" rating (August 21). - National Bankshares raised target to C$62 with a "sector perform" rating (August 21). - BMO Capital Markets raised target to C$68 (August 21). - Raymond James Financial raised target to C$70 with "outperform" (August 21). - CIBC raised target to C$71 (September 2). - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy" with a consensus target of C$65.25. - EMA stock traded up C$0.44 to C$69.49 on Wednesday, September 2. - Insider Judy Ann Steele sold 18,100 shares (September 2), decreasing position by 98.09%. - Insider Archibald Collins sold 30,600 shares (September 2), decreasing position by 70.11%. - Insiders have sold 49,494 shares over the last 90 days, valued at $3,213,691.

However, CIBC lowered rating from "strong-buy" to "hold" which reduces the score by -0.1. The net effect is +0.2. Insider Selling: Significant insider selling (Judy Ann Steele and Archibald Collins) is a negative signal, reducing the score by -0.2. Dividend: Stable dividend with a 4.2% yield is neutral, contributing 0. Stock Splits/Consolidations: Not applicable (0). Other Financial Metrics: The inclusion of financial ratios (P/E, PEG, Beta, Debt-to-equity, Quick ratio, Current ratio) is largely backward-looking and doesn't significantly impact the forward-looking sentiment. Therefore, it receives a very low score (0). 52-week high: Positive momentum, +0.1. Backward-looking data: The mention of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages is largely historical and receives a low score (0). --- <br> - Emera is experiencing positive momentum with several analysts upgrading their price targets, though insider selling is a notable factor. Investors should monitor insider activity alongside the positive analyst sentiment and dividend yield to assess the stock's trajectory. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - EMA reached a 52-week high after Desjardins raised price target to C$68.00 (previously C$64.00). - RBC increased price target to C$70.00 (previously C$69.00) with an "outperform" rating (Aug 11). - CIBC lowered rating from "strong-buy" to "hold" (Aug 11). - BMO Capital Markets increased price target to C$68.00 (Aug 11). - TD Securities increased price target to C$74.00 with a "buy" rating (Aug 11). - CIBC increased price target to C$71.00 (Aug 12). - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy" with a target of C$65.25. - Insider Judy Ann Steele sold 18,100 shares (C$1,174,690) reducing position by 98.09%. - Insider Archibald Collins sold 30,600 shares (C$1,987,470) reducing position by 70.11%. - Total insider sales over 90 days: 49,494 shares (C$3,213,691). - Stock up 0.2%. 50-day moving average: C$66.06, 200-day: C$63.27. - Market cap: C$20.71 billion.
