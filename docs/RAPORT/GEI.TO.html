This indicates positive sentiment and a belief in future performance, warranting a positive score. Analyst meetings (upgrades): Several brokerages have upgraded GEI and increased their price targets. This contributes a +0.1 to +0.2 score. Insider buying: David Gosse's purchase of shares is a positive signal, adding a small +0.05. The mention of a dividend is neutral, as it's a known fact and doesn't represent a change. The backward-looking data (past year trends, current stock price) and promotional language are given very low weight. The consensus price target is a signal of future expectations, but not a direct event, so it's factored in less strongly. --- <br> - Gibson Energy (GEI) maintains a "Moderate Buy" rating with a consensus price target of C$26.50. Recent upgrades from several brokerages, including price target increases, suggest positive sentiment. Monitor insider buying and dividend yield for potential investment opportunities. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - GEI has a "Moderate Buy" rating from 12 analysts. - Average 1-year price target: C$26.50. - Raymond James increased target to C$30.50 on June 17th. - Jefferies raised rating to "Buy" and target to C$28.00 on July 23rd. - Scotiabank increased target to C$27.00 with "outperform" rating on July 29th. - Wells Fargo increased target to C$24.00 on July 29th. - ATB Capital increased target to C$27.00 with "outperform" rating on July 29th. - Current stock price: C$26.00 (down C$0.03). - Market cap: C$4.26 billion. - Dividend of $0.43 per share, payable Oct 17th. - Insider David Gosse purchased 2,255 shares at C$23.50 on June 9th. - Insiders own 0.85% of the company's stock.

The news explicitly states GEI exceeded EPS estimates by $0.07. This contributes a score of +0.3. 52-week high: While positive, hitting a 52-week high is often a result of other factors and doesn't inherently signal a major financial shift. It's a consequence of positive sentiment, but not a primary driver. It contributes a small +0.05. Analyst ratings: The news mentions mixed analyst ratings ("Moderate Buy"). While analyst ratings are generally low-impact, the "Moderate Buy" consensus adds a slight positive, contributing +0.05. Revenue meeting expectations: This is neutral, contributing 0. Backward-looking data/promotional language: The mention of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, beta, debt-to-equity ratio, quick ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and market capitalization are all backward-looking data points. These are given very low weight. Other metrics: The other metrics are not impactful enough to warrant a score. --- <br> - Gibson Energy reached a 52-week high, supported by mixed analyst ratings. The company exceeded EPS estimates, demonstrating financial strength. Investors should monitor future performance and analyst updates before making decisions. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - GBNXF stock hit a 52-week high of $18.96 on Monday. - Raymond James reiterates "strong-buy" on June 17th. - National Bankshares rates "sector perform" on July 30th. - TD Securities lowered rating from "strong-buy" to "hold" on June 17th. - Scotiabank reissued "outperform" rating on July 30th. - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy." - Debt-to-equity ratio is 2.78. - Quick ratio is 0.58. - Market capitalization is $3.10 billion. - Price-to-earnings ratio is 27.03. - Beta is 0.86. - 50-day moving average is $17.96, 200-day is $16.56. - Q3 EPS was $0.27, beating estimates by $0.07. - Revenue was $1.28 billion, meeting expectations.

The "Moderate Buy" consensus rating adds a small positive impact. Insider Buying: Insider David Bruce Gosse's purchase of shares is a positive signal, contributing +0.1. Dividend: The strong dividend yield (6.6%) is a positive factor, adding +0.05. Stock Price Dip: The slight dip in stock price is a minor negative, but its impact is minimal. Financial Ratios: The provided financial ratios (debt-to-equity, current ratio, quick ratio, market cap, P/E, PEG, beta) are largely neutral as they are backward-looking data. Oil Infrastructure Company: The description of the company as an "oil infrastructure company" is neutral. TD Securities downgrade: The downgrade from "strong-buy" to "hold" is a minor negative, but the target price increase offsets it somewhat. Backward-looking data: The news contains a lot of backward-looking data, which receives a very low score. --- <br> - Gibson Energy is receiving positive attention from analysts, with several upgrades and price target increases. While the stock price dipped slightly recently, the company's strong dividend yield (6.6%) and insider buying signal potential.
