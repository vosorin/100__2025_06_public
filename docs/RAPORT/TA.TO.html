Analyst Ratings (Slightly Positive): +0.1. A "Moderate Buy" consensus rating and a target price are mildly positive, but the mixed ratings prevent a higher score. Dividend Announcement (Slightly Positive): +0.05. The announcement of a dividend signals stability and commitment to shareholder returns. The yield is relatively low, and the DPR is negative, which limits the positive impact. Negative PE Ratio: -0.05. A negative PE ratio is a red flag and indicates the company is currently unprofitable. This offsets some of the positive sentiment. Backward-Looking Data/Publicity: -0.05.
