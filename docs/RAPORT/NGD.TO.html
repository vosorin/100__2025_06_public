This contributes a +0.2. leadership shift: Agnico Eagle Mines (NGD.TO) taking the lead in production is a positive development, indicating improved operational efficiency.

This falls under the category of product launches (new discoveries/resource expansion can be considered a product launch in the mining context) with strong market potential. The reported mineralization outside the current resource estimate and the high percentage of holes intersecting gold mineralization are positive indicators. The planned Pre-Feasibility Study is a step towards development. However, the Pre-Feasibility Study isn't until H1 2026, which pushes the impact into the future and limits the immediate impact. The inferred resource size is also relatively modest. Therefore, the score is moderately positive, but not overwhelmingly so. --- <br> - Newcore Gold's latest drilling results at the Kwakyekrom deposit demonstrate continued resource growth potential through expanded mineralization both near-surface and at depth. Investors should monitor the progress towards the Pre-Feasibility Study and further drilling updates to assess the full extent of this potential. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - NCAU (Newcore Gold) released positive drill results from the Enchi Gold Project in Ghana. - Drilling at Kwakyekrom intersected gold mineralization outside the current resource estimate. - KKRC099: 1.08 g/t Au over 22.0 m, with 2.78 g/t Au over 7.0 m. - KKRC085A: 1.29 g/t Au over 15.0 m. - 28,940 m drilled in 231 holes reported so far in the 2024-2025 program. - 98.7% of drilled holes intersected gold mineralization. - Focus on resource growth and infill drilling to convert Inferred to Indicated resources. - Pre-Feasibility Study planned for H1 2026. - Kwakyekrom has an Inferred Mineral Resource of 4.2 million tonnes grading 0.72 g/t Au.
