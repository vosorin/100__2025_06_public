Quarterly or annual results (above expectations): +0.2 (Q1 EPS beat estimates by $0.26 and revenue exceeded expectations. This is a significant positive.) Institutional buying activity: +0.1 (Significant increases in holdings by multiple institutional investors like TCTC Holdings, Geneos Wealth, EverSource Wealth, Spire Wealth Management, and STRS Ohio. This indicates confidence.) P/E ratio: -0.05 (The relatively high P/E ratio is noted, which introduces a slight cautionary element, tempering the overall positive sentiment.) The backward-looking data (past year trends) and the volume being below average are given very low absolute scores and are therefore not factored into the final score. --- <br> - FirstService (FSV) is receiving positive attention from analysts, with upgrades and increased price targets. Strong recent earnings, revenue growth, and institutional buying activity suggest a positive outlook. Investors should consider this, but also note the relatively high P/E ratio. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - FSV upgraded to "Buy" by Wall Street Zen, previously "Hold." - TD Securities raised price target to $211 (from $200), rating "Hold." - Scotiabank raised price target to $220, rating "Sector Perform." - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy," target price $217.75. - Stock traded up $4.38 on Friday, closing at $208.98. - Volume was 79,079 shares, below average of 133,356. - Market cap is $9.52 billion, P/E ratio 66.97, beta 0.96. - Q1 EPS beat estimates by $0.26 at $1.71 vs $1.45 expected. - Revenue increased 9.1% YoY to $1.42 billion, above $1.40 billion estimate. - Analysts predict EPS of 5.27 for the current fiscal year. - Institutional buying: TCTC Holdings increased by 155.2%, Geneos Wealth by 63.7%. - Strs Ohio acquired a new stake, EverSource Wealth increased by 400%. - Spire Wealth Management increased position by 52.1%. - 69.35% of stock owned by institutional investors.

This is generally viewed negatively as it signals a potential lack of confidence from an insider, warranting investor caution. This contributes a score of -0.3. However, the news also includes a "Hold" rating and price target of C$214 from TD Securities. This slightly mitigates the negative impact, adding +0.1. The inclusion of financial ratios (debt-to-equity, current ratio, quick ratio) and market data (market cap, PE ratio, Beta, 52-week range) are backward-looking and don't significantly impact the forward-looking sentiment, so they receive a very low score. Analyst ratings generally receive a low score, unless there is a clear consensus across all analysts. --- <br> - A director's recent sale of a significant portion of their shares (23.08%) warrants investor caution, though the stock maintains a "Hold" rating and price target of C$214. Monitor trading volume and analyst updates. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Director Erin Joy Wallace sold 3,000 FSV shares on August 26th. - Sale price: C$275.74/share, totaling C$827,214. - Wallace now holds 10,000 shares, valued at C$2,757,380. - Previous sale: 3,000 shares on June 24th at C$241.51/share. - FSV stock traded at C$284.99 on August 26th, below average volume. - Debt-to-equity ratio: 136.54, current ratio: 1.81, quick ratio: 1.25. - Market cap: C$12.98 billion, PE ratio: 91.34, Beta: 0.95. - 52-week range: C$220.39 - C$285.35. - TD Securities raised target price to C$214 with a "Hold" rating. - Consensus rating: "Hold" with a target price of C$214.

However, several institutions increasing stakes (+0.1). The net effect is minimal. Analyst Upgrades: Wall Street Zen upgraded to "buy" (+0.1). TD Securities reaffirmed a "hold" rating (neutral). EPS Beat: Q2 EPS beat estimates by $0.26 (+0.2). Revenue Growth: Revenue increased 9.1% YoY (+0.1). Analyst Target Price: Average analyst target price is $217.75 (low score, but slightly positive). Backward-Looking Data: The mention of last year's EPS ($1.36) and YoY revenue growth is given a very low score as it's historical. Share Ownership: 69.35% ownership by institutional investors (low score, but slightly positive). The positive elements (EPS beat, revenue growth, some institutional buying, analyst upgrade) are partially offset by the significant selling by Fred Alger. --- <br> - FirstService (FSV) shows mixed signals. While several institutional investors increased their stakes, Fred Alger Management sold a significant portion. Positive EPS and revenue growth, coupled with analyst upgrades, suggest potential, but investors should monitor institutional activity. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Fred Alger Management sold 40,857 shares ($95.49M) of FSV in Q1, reducing holdings by 6.6%. - TCTC Holdings increased its stake by 155.2%, owning 171 shares ($28K). - Spire Wealth Management boosted its stake by 52.1%, now owning 543 shares ($90K). - SVB Wealth LLC initiated a new position valued at $90,000 in Q1. - State of Wyoming started a new stake valued at approximately $101,000 in Q4. - Fifth Third Bancorp increased its stake by 23.0%, owning 769 shares ($128K). - 69.35% of FSV is owned by institutional investors. - TD Securities reaffirmed a "hold" rating, Wall Street Zen upgraded to "buy". - Average analyst target price is $217.75, consensus rating "Moderate Buy". - FSV opened at $201.58, market cap $9.18B, P/E ratio 64.61. - Q2 EPS was $1.71, beating estimates by $0.26; revenue $1.42B. - Revenue increased 9.1% YoY, EPS $1.36 last year. - Analysts predict 5.27 EPS for the current year.
