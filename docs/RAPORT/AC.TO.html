The announcement of potential new markets is also a mildly positive signal for future growth. The timing (Q1 2026) means it's a future event, but the explicit mention of potential profitability improvements warrants a slightly positive score.

This introduces operational risk and negatively impacts investor sentiment. Here's a breakdown of the contributing factors: Major political actions like war or major strikes: -0.3 (The potential for further strikes or arbitration is a significant operational risk and negatively impacts the airline's ability to operate efficiently and predictably. The previous strike and the anticipation of government intervention highlight the potential for disruption.) Low wage concerns: -0.1 (The fact that proposed wages are still below the federal minimum wage is a concerning detail that could further complicate negotiations and potentially lead to more disruptive action.) CEO Admission: -0.1 (The CEO's expectation of government intervention is a negative signal, suggesting a lack of confidence in reaching a resolution through standard negotiations.) The other events listed don't apply or have a negligible impact on the situation. Promotional language and backward-looking data are ignored. --- <br> - Air Canada faces a significant setback as flight attendants overwhelmingly rejected the latest wage offer, pushing negotiations into mediation and potentially arbitration.

Score: -0.1 Wage Increases: While the proposed wage increases (20% entry-level, 16% experienced) are substantial, they represent a future cost that will impact profitability.
