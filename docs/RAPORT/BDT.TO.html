Raymond James downgrade: The downgrade from "strong-buy" to "moderate buy" slightly reduces the score (-0.05). Rationale: The news is primarily driven by positive analyst actions and upward revisions of EPS estimates. While the debt-to-equity ratio is mentioned, it doesn's appear to be a major concern. The Raymond James downgrade is a minor negative. The overall sentiment leans positive due to the consensus "Buy" rating and upward target price revisions. --- <br> - Bird Construction is experiencing positive sentiment with multiple analysts revising their ratings and target prices upwards.

This is a negative signal, but the impact is mitigated by the overall positive acquisition news, so a small negative impact is applied. Dividend yield: The 3.4% dividend yield is a positive factor, but not a major change, so a small positive score of +0.05 is applied.
