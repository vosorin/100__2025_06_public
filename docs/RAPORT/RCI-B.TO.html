This is a positive sign and contributes a significant portion of the score. EPS Beat (+0.2): Exceeding EPS expectations is a positive surprise, contributing to the overall score. Revenue Miss (-0.1): Missing revenue estimates is a negative, but the EPS beat somewhat offsets this. Analyst Ratings (0): The "Hold" rating and price target are standard and don't significantly impact the score. Analyst ratings generally receive a low score unless there's a clear consensus. Backward-Looking Data (0): The news mentions past quarter performance, which receives a low score. Stock Price Information (0): The opening price and 52-week range are informational but don't inherently impact the financial outlook. --- <br> - Several institutional investors significantly increased their stake in Rogers Communication in recent quarters, signaling confidence. While recent earnings missed revenue estimates, the company still exceeded EPS expectations. Investors should monitor future earnings reports and analyst ratings. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - TD Waterhouse Canada Inc. acquired 304,819 shares, increasing holdings by 12.1% in Q2. - Goldman Sachs increased holdings by 303.8% during Q1, owning 5,538,620 shares. - Platinum Investment Management bought a new position valued at $77.09 million in Q2. - Canada Pension Plan Investment Board increased position by 373.1% during Q1, owning 2,870,559 shares. - Connor Clark & Lunn Investment Management raised stake by 380.4% during Q1, owning 2,348,091 shares. - Canoe Financial LP boosted holdings by 550.0% in Q2, owning 1,421,228 shares. - Analysts have a consensus rating of "Hold" with a price target of $36.00. - RCI opened at $38.54 on Wednesday, with a 52-week range of $23.18 - $40.26. - Q3 EPS was $0.99, exceeding estimates of $0.92. - Revenue for the quarter was $3.84 billion, below estimates of $5.33 billion.

This falls under "analyst meetings" and generally indicates a positive outlook on the company's future performance. While not a dramatic shift, multiple upgrades from different institutions suggest a growing consensus. The score is relatively low (0.2) because analyst ratings typically receive a low score unless there's a clear consensus. The increase in trading volume is below average, which slightly tempers the positive sentiment. The backward-looking data (market cap, PE ratio, subscriber numbers) receives a very low score. --- <br> - Rogers Communications is receiving positive attention from analysts, with multiple price target increases and "buy" ratings. While a potential downside exists based on one target, the overall sentiment is bullish. Investors should consider this positive momentum alongside their own due diligence. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Barclays upped target price from C$46.00 to C$50.00 on Monday. - Canaccord Genuity increased target from C$55.00 to C$57.00 on Oct 24. - Scotiabank raised target from C$55.75 to C$57.75 on Oct 26. - JPMorgan Chase boosted target from C$59.00 to C$62.00 on Oct 28. - CIBC raised target from C$55.00 to C$58.00 on Oct 17. - Desjardins increased target from C$53.00 to C$56.00 on Oct 24. - Average analyst rating is "Moderate Buy" with a C$57.40 target. - Stock traded up C$0.42 to C$52.91 on Monday. - Trading volume was 386,715 shares, below average (1,964,953). - Market cap is C$28.58 billion, PE ratio is 4.24. - Rogers is Canada's largest wireless provider with 10+ million subscribers.
