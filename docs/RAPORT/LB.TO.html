This indicates a negative outlook and contributes significantly to the score. (-0.2) Quarterly Results: While the Q3 EPS slightly beat estimates (+0.1), this is overshadowed by the negative margins and history of earnings decline. The slight beat is not enough to offset the negative sentiment. Negative Margins/ROE: The negative net margin and return on equity are significant red flags and contribute to the negative outlook. (-0.1) Backward-Looking Data: The 12-month high/low, 50/200-day moving averages, and P/E ratio are all backward-looking data and receive a very low score. Analyst Consensus: The consensus "Reduce" rating is a key factor in the negative assessment. The overall impression is one of caution and potential downside, driven by analyst downgrades and concerning financial metrics. --- <br> - Laurentian Bank of Canada (LB) faces mixed analyst sentiment, with a prevailing "Reduce" rating and an average price target of C$30.57, suggesting potential downside. While recent earnings slightly beat estimates, negative margins and a history of earnings decline warrant caution for investors. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - LB price target lowered to C$26.00 by National Bankshares, indicating 15% downside. - Desjardins raised target to C$30.00 with a "sell" rating (August 13). - CIBC raised target to C$35.00 with a "neutral" rating (August 20). - Scotiabank raised target to C$32.00 with a "sector perform" rating (June 2). - Veritas rates LB as "strong sell" (June 2). - Raymond James raised target to C$30.00 with a "market perform" rating. - Average analyst rating is "Reduce" with a C$30.57 target. - LB stock traded up C$0.09 to C$30.59 with 200,841 shares exchanged. - 50-day moving average: C$30.89; 200-day moving average: C$28.79. - 12-month low: C$24.37; 12-month high: C$31.74. - Market cap: C$1.36 billion; P/E ratio: 10.03; Beta: 1.65. - Q3 EPS: C$0.73 (beat estimate by C$0.01). - Negative net margin: 0.30%; negative return on equity: 0.20%. - Analysts anticipate EPS of 3.84 for the current fiscal year.

Here's a breakdown: Analyst Meetings/Ratings: The core of the news is the downgrades from Desjardins and others ("Sell," "Underperform," "Strong Sell"). While Jefferies and Scotiabank have slightly more positive views, the overall tone is negative. This contributes a score of -0.15. Guidance Updates: The reduction in FY2026 earnings estimate by Desjardins (-$0.15 from $3.45 to $3.30) indicates a downward revision of future expectations. This contributes a score of -0.10. Stock Price Movement: The stock traded down, which reinforces the negative sentiment. This contributes a minor score of -0.05. The information regarding the 52-week range and market cap is backward-looking and doesn't significantly impact the forward-looking sentiment. Analyst ratings generally receive a low score unless there is a clear consensus, which isn't the case here. --- <br> - Laurentian Bank of Canada (LB) faces a challenging outlook as Desjardins downgraded earnings forecasts and maintains a "Sell" rating. While other analysts have varied opinions, the overall sentiment leans towards caution. Investors should carefully consider these downgrades before investing. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Desjardins reduced FY2026 earnings estimate to $3.30/share, down from $3.45. - Desjardins maintains a "Sell" rating with a $30.00 price target (August 2024). - Consensus estimate for full-year earnings is $3.84/share. - National Bankshares rates "underperform" with a target of C$28.00 (June 3, 2024). - Raymond James Financial rates with a target of C$28.00 (June 3, 2024). - Veritas rates as "strong sell" (June 2, 2024). - Jefferies Financial Group upped price objective to C$31.00 (Wednesday). - Scotiabank upped price objective to C$32.00 with "sector perform" (June 3, 2024). - Average analyst rating is "Hold" with a consensus target of C$30.29. - LB stock traded down C$0.19 to C$30.86 (August 2024). - 52-week range: C$24.37 - C$31.74. - Market cap: C$1.36 billion.
