Quarterly Results: Q3 earnings were $0.44 EPS, beating estimates by $0.11 (+0.2). Revenue Increase: Revenue increased 41.7% year-over-year to $1.75 billion (+0.05). This is a significant increase, but the backward-looking nature limits the score. Dividend: A quarterly dividend of $0.03 was paid (+0.0). Institutional Investor Activity: Mixed activity (some reducing, some increasing) is essentially neutral (0). Market Cap: The market cap figure is purely descriptive and has no impact on the score. Backward-Looking Data: The year-over-year revenue increase is considered backward-looking and receives a low score. The positive factors (analyst upgrades, earnings beat, revenue increase) are slightly outweighed by the mixed institutional activity and the downgrades. --- <br> - Kinross Gold (KGC) faces mixed institutional investor activity, with some reducing holdings while others increase.

Note: The news contains backward-looking data (revenue increase YoY) and analyst ratings, which are given low weight. The focus is on the positive momentum indicated by recent earnings and analyst actions. --- <br> - Kinross Gold (KGC) maintains a "Moderate Buy" rating with a target price around $20, supported by recent analyst upgrades and institutional buying. Strong Q2 earnings and a dividend payout suggest positive momentum, but investors should monitor broader market conditions and gold prices. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - KGC has a "Moderate Buy" rating from eleven analysts, with a target price of $20.07. - Jefferies raised rating to "buy" with a target of $18 (June 26). - RBC lifted target to $19, rating "sector perform" (June 1). - Zacks lowered rating to "hold" (Sept 1). - Canaccord Genuity raised target to $29.50 with a "buy" rating (Aug 7). - National Bankshares reiterated "outperform" (June 24). - Institutional investors increased holdings in Q2, with Osaic Holdings up 203%. - KGC opened at $22.37 on Wednesday. - Q2 EPS was $0.44, beating estimates by $0.11. - Revenue increased 41.7% YoY to $1.75 billion. - Quarterly dividend of $0.03 paid on Sept 4. - Kinross Gold operates mines in US, Brazil, Chile, Canada, and Mauritania.

Insider selling, while not inherently negative, can signal a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects. The scale of the selling (CA$32 million) and the CEO's significant sales (CA$18 million) are noteworthy and warrant investor caution. The lack of corresponding purchases further reinforces this negative signal. Here's a breakdown of the scoring based on the provided events: Management Changes/Insider Activity: This is the most relevant event. While not a formal management change, significant insider selling, especially by the CEO, acts as a negative signal. A score of -0.3 reflects this caution. The lack of purchases amplifies the negative sentiment. --- <br> - Kinross Gold insiders have been net sellers over the past year, with significant sales recently and no corresponding purchases. While profits are growing, the selling activity warrants caution for investors. <br><br>*** REZUMAT *** - Insiders sold CA$32m worth of shares (2.11m shares) in the last year. - CEO J.

Several funds increased their stake (+0.1). The net effect is close to neutral. accretive to DCF per share: 0 credit rating changes: 0 regulatory changes: 0 promotional language/backward-looking data: The YoY revenue and EPS increases are backward-looking and receive a very low score, effectively cancelling out the negative impact of the stake reduction. --- <br> - Kinross Gold's stock saw a 5.6% stake reduction by a major Quebec investment group, but overall, institutional investor sentiment appears positive with several funds increasing their positions.
